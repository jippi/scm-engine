### `merge_request.state_is(string...) -> boolean` {: #merge_request.state_is data-toc-label="state_is"}

Check if the `merge_request` state is any of the provided states

**Valid options**:

- `closed` - In closed state
- `locked` - Discussion has been locked
- `merged` - Merge request has been merged
- `opened` - Opened merge request

### `duration(string) -> duration` {: #duration data-toc-label="duration"}

Returns the [`time.Duration`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration) value of the given string str.

Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h", "d" and "w".

```css
duration("1h").Seconds() == 3600
```

### `uniq([]string) -> []string` {: #uniq data-toc-label="uniq"}

Returns a new array where all duplicate values has been removed.

```css
(["hello", "world", "world"] | uniq) == ["hello", "world"]
```

### `filepath_dir` {: #filepath_dir data-toc-label="filepath_dir"}

`filepath_dir` returns all but the last element of path, typically the path's directory. After dropping the final element,

Dir calls [Clean](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Clean) on the path and trailing slashes are removed.

If the path is empty, `filepath_dir` returns ".". If the path consists entirely of separators, `filepath_dir` returns a single separator.

The returned path does not end in a separator unless it is the root directory.

```css
filepath_dir("example/directory/file.go") == "example/directory"
```

### `limit_path_depth_to` {: #limit_path_depth_to data-toc-label="limit_path_depth_to"}

`limit_path_depth_to` takes a path structure, and limits it to the configured maximum depth. Particularly useful when using `generated` labels from a directory structure, and want to to have a label naming scheme that only uses path of the path.

```css
limit_path_depth_to("path1/path2/path3/path4", 2), == "path1/path2"
limit_path_depth_to("path1/path2", 3), == "path1/path2"
```
